##Requirements:
 
 Create a one - two player game that encompasses what we have learned in the first three weeks of General Assembl's Web Development Immersive. The project must have a game page and landing page. The landing pages must be a copied design. 
 
##Inspiration:

The game was inspired by whack-a-mole and sushi conveyor belt restaurants 

##Introduction:

Sushime is a clicker based game that gives you 60 seconds to eat as much sushi as you can.

##Game Play:

After time runs out an alert will pop up with your final score.

##Logic



##Future Improvements
I was not able to create the game I orignally planned. I got caught up in smaller details and did not estimate the time it would take me to figure out some of the problems. But, I would like to go back and improve this game to my original design:

-Add a updating scoreboard
-Add two or three more types of sushi with varying score values
-Add difficulty levels 
-Fix the overlap of sushi populating per plate
